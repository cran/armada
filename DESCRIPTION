Description: Two steps variable selection procedure in a context of high-dimensional dependent data
  but few observations. First step is dedicated to eliminate dependence between variables (clustering
  of variables, followed by factor analysis inside each cluster).
  Second step is a variable selection using by aggregation of adapted methods.
